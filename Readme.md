# dir

Just a really dirty, simple HTML page to sort out my browser tabs. I'm using [Tree Style Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) plugin for Firefox and sometimes I want to have some tabs sorted out by category rather than from they were opened from. With this app I can create extra tabs to have everything sorted out


Everything you put after the `?` in the URL gets moved to the `<title>` tag. Additionally, the links in the page work as shortcuts to common dirs I use.
